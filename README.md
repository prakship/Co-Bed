## Predicting date by which USA will run out of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients - developed as a part of CATHACKS VI hackathon

1. As part of the CATHACKS VI we created a time series model which will predict the date by which USA will run out of hospital beds.

2. This project is not complete yet as I am still learning Time series concepts in my current semester and would be adding better model implementation soon.
